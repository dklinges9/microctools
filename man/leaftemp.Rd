a list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{tn}{air temperature of each layer (tc)}
\item{tleaf}{leaf temperature of each layer (deg C)}
\item{ea}{vapour pressure (kPa)}
\item{gtt}{heat conductance to reference height two m above canopy}
\item{Rem}{emitted radiation (W / m^2)}
\item{H}{Sensible heat flux from leaf to air (W / m^2)}
\item{L}{Latent heat of vapourisation from leaf to air (W / m^2)}
\item{Lc}{Latent heat of condenstation from leaf to air (W / m^2)}

}
\description{
Calculates leaf temperature from radiation fluxes and reference air
and ground tempertaure
}
\details{
\code{leaftemp} computes the average leaf and air temperature of each canopy layer based on
radiation and evaorative fluxes and reference air and ground temperature. The function
automatically determines whether heat storage should be considered, based the specific heat
capacity of the vegetation layer and the time step of the model.
