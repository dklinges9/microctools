Description: The functions in the microCtools packageare used by the microclimC 
    package for modelling the mechanistic processes that govern microclimate above 
    or vegetated canopies. It includes tools for heat and vapour conductance, radiation 
    absorbed or emmited by leaves and an implementation of the Thomas and Newton-Raphson 
    algorithms for solving simultaniously heat fluxes between soil or air layers. Unlike 
    microclima, the functions are designed for modelling time-series at single locations.
